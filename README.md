# WAVLtree
This class is an implementation of the WAVLtree, arelatively new data structure which is an improvement on the well known rank-balanced tree data structures AVL-trees and Red-Black trees. 

The WAVL tree can support search, insert and delete in O(logn) time, while doing a constant number of rebalancing steps for each operation.<br/>
